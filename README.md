# Compendium
---
Compendium- (noun)
*a collection of concise but detailed information about a particular subject, especially in a book or other publication.

Compendium is an app designed to allow the user to organize, update, itemize and otherwise keep track of their collections. No matter what someone collects, it is often extraordinarily hard for them to organize and display it in a way that allows for sharing or documentation. We have designed a simple, user friendly solution. 

In the future, we aim to add social media aspects, e-commerce and mobile-phone app aspects that allow the user to sell, share or send their passions right from their devices.
